    "On May 5th, a landscape maintenance worker was stung multiple times by a swarm of bees after unknowingly disturbing a hidden hive in a bush while trimming foliage around the premises. He immediately ran from the area, but had already sustained several stings on his arms and neck. Co-workers administered ice packs and called emergency services. Though he did not suffer a severe allergic reaction, the incident resulted in swelling and required a precautionary visit to urgent care. The groundskeeping schedule was adjusted, and a pest control team was dispatched to handle the hive safely."
